# Inaccuracies and Inconsistencies

## Color Harmony

- Yellow (#FFD700) and dark teal (#2F4858) may provide sufficient contrast, but golden yellow may be too bright on a light background (e.g., white), causing visual fatigue.
- Golden yellow may be too bright for larger areas. It is recommended to test different shades of yellow with users to find the most pleasant and functional option.

## Interactive Elements

- Using a golden yellow background (#FFD700) for interactive boxes may be too dominant and visually tiring. Consider softer tones or additional neutral colors to balance the design.

## Visual Load

- To maintain overall harmony, it is important to ensure that the page is not overloaded with bright colors. Excessive use of colors and elements can make the page visually tiring.

## Color and Contrast Testing

- It is important to conduct contrast tests to ensure sufficient readability and accessibility. Color blindness simulations and adherence to WCAG standards help ensure the site is accessible to all users.

In conclusion, while the brand book provides a strong foundation for the design of the Kalda Talu website, it is essential to pay attention to the harmony of colors and fonts, visual balance, and accessibility.
